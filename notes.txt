JAVA FUNDAMENTALS:
Class - (abstract way of representing the objects)Hierarchy header - contains methods to perform certain actions - methods can be accessed using an object of the class.;
Method - Small piece of code performing certain action - Syntax : <Access modifier> <return type> <Method name>(){} - Ex: public void writeHelloWorldToConsole(){};
Data Types:
Whole numbers - integer or int (ex: int age = 30;)
Very big whole number - Long or long (ex: long starsInGalaxy = 10000000000000000L;)
Text values - String (ex: String name = "Joe";)
Floating point decimal values - Float or float (ex: float weight = 76.53;)
More precise Floating point decimal values - Double or double (ex: double PI = 3.141592653;)
Final Key word:
We use 'Final' key word for variables which we do not wan to change further.
String:
String is a class in java to declare text variables, with which we can use many other in built methods to work with strings (ex: length(), replace(). touppercase(). tolowercase())
Class:

Objects - are the actual things, have values,
Setters & Getters
this - is a special keyword that defines to refer to the values in class
Access modifier - Public, private

JAVA Conventions:
method names in camel case - First letter in small and every new word with capital letter (ex: firstJavaMethod(){})
